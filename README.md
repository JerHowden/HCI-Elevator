#### Design Issues

I was on the top floor of Holden when I came up to this elevator, and the first thing you notice is that there's two buttons on the outside. Typically these are for going up or down based on your current floor, but I was already on the top floor, so the top button is irrelevant.

The floor buttons on the inside panel were clearly labeled and in correct vertical order, but it went **3**->**2**->**1**->**V**->**G**. What do **V** and **G** stand for? There's only four floors in Holden and this ordering gives the impression there's another floor below the basement.

Some of the buttons weren't even functional. There was a small sign over them saying not to touch them, showing that this panel is unreliable.
